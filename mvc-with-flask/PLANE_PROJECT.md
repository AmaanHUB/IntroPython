	* Admin, should be able to see how many seats on board, -1 from total number of seats available
	* airport assisstant, create passengers with name and passport number so can add them to flight
	* airport assisstant i want to be able to create `flight_trip` with specific destination
	* airport assisstant want to be able to add passenger to `flight_trip` so that I can sell tickets to them
	* airport assistant want to be able to generate `flight_attendees_list_report` that list passenger names and passsports so can check identity documents

* Notes on seats and ages:
	* 0-24 months is infant price, don't usually given a seat and charged less money
	* 2-12 years is children price, 50-70% price, given seat
	* 12+, full price
	* So .e.g. 100 seat plane, could sold 110 tickets since 10 babies are on laps
		* .e.g. 100 seat plane, not make 1000Â£ as some children in seats
